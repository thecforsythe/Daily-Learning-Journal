Today was the beginning of project week. In the morning we laid out plans for our hotel site, specified requirements and assigned tasks. I will be working on the graphics. After beginning the layout of the site, I  struggled with my wrapper div not filling vertically. It was  not expanding to the height I assigned to it. I was able to find a solution on the web that suggested setting the body and html height to 100%, margins and padding to 0. Then on the wrapper div I set the height to auto and min-height to 100%.
It works...I was then able to get the other divs to cooperate after some cajoling. My header width I set to inherit, so that it copied the width from its parent, the wrapper div. Otherwise width 960px would not expand across the page and width 100% made it expand out of the wrapper, but only on the right side.
