Wow, week three is halfway done. What a series of highs and lows. On the down side I feel that my slowness/inaptitude to pick up on the java script is preventing me from succeeding in this class. At this point I feel that the parts I have not understood are compounding into a wall that prevents me from completing assignments.

 On the other hand I like the css and html. The css is challenging but feels learnable. Html makes sense. I feel a sense of satisfaction when I can solve the problems I am having with css. While the websites I have designed so far are not "pretty", I can see its possibilities and know that I only need to put in the time to learn and conquer the quirkiness of the program.

 Not sure how I can reconcile these two very different experiences I am having.
