Today I had fun working on the the chocolate pizza exercise. My partner Benjamin, despite saying that he doesn't care for the design side of web design, has a solid understanding of absolute and relative positioning, floats, and div containers. I learned a lot by working with and strategizing with him on how to build a rendition of the blog post. It was really great to have an alternate point of view on how to tackle layout problems. I think we worked well has a team and we were both able to contribute to the project. I wish I was more knowledgable about git and the process of merging/branching/forking so that I could have worked concurrently on a few problems we encountered. However now that I am reflecting on the day I could have pasted code into slack and sent it to him to stick into the master document that way. That was dumb, but I guess thats why we do the journaling. I think we were both concerned that using git would become a potential pitfall and with a project that was due in a few hours we wanted to stick to a full proof method!! I am excited to have the opportunity to do more work like this in week 4 and perhaps sooner.
