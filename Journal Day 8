The beginning part of the week has been challenging, with the introduction of many ideas in Java Script. While I am slowly learning these ideas I feel with enough time and practice I can conquer them. I have enjoyed the design parts of the course and can't wait to really sink my teeth into it during the project in week 4. 

In class today we discussed events and how they could be used to connect actions the user preforms on the page with code to make the actions produce results. On the HTML side of things terminology was a bit of a stumbling block to get going. Trying to learn and internalize the differences between form, fieldset, legend, type, input, name, placeholder, min, max, etc, etc. Took some doing. It not that those are difficult idea to conceptualize but there are just some many terms you need to get straight to more forward.

On the JS end of things, the lesson relates to the things we learned yesterday about creating elements, text Content and append child so it is not to far of a leap to figure out how to get the code to connect , however I still need to get mine to work.
