Today was the final day of 201. I pulled most of an all nighter to get the website looking as best as I could and iron out some of the small things that were bothering me. As I worked on the site I though about how the project idea is intriguing but our solution to the problem is fairly clunky. Our site, in its current state, would only be usable for a hotel with one or two floors. If you were booking a room in a large city and the hotel had many floors it would be a huge drag to have to look through all of the rooms to pick the one you want. There would have to be:
  A) A better way to show which rooms where available on which floors.
  B) Much more suffocated search criteria to narrow down search results.
  C) Definitely a way to search by price.

  things I wish I had time to fix but didn't:
  1) custom checkboxes and dropdown menu'
  2) better looking hotel drawing
  3) maybe cool transition between each size of display rather than "continual spectrum" of display
  4) change the way the picture on the landing page displays/crops as the screen size gets smaller. As it stands in iphone mode its mostly just nighttime sky. Could really benefit from having a picture with content visible to the user.
  5)insert features to make it easier to click on buttons (bigger target)
  6) give a basic description of each room type and what amenities come standard
