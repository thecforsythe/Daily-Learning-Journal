I enjoyed the demo jess gave about video and sound. As we were introduced to some of the possibilities available to include in a website I couldn't help but imagine incorporating those features into some sort of "art" website. Sound and video are so easily over done in normal context, but why not take them to the max and build a site that is a collection of only sound, video and special effect features. Embrace them for what they are and fun with it. Capture moods, colors. Take a journey through a div landscape loaded with psychedelic hover effects and expanding and contracting elements. Who know where the next button click will take you.
