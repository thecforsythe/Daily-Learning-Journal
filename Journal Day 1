pretty sure I screwed up the location of my journal, I will ask for help tomorrow morning. text below <h1> Code 201, Day 2</h1> today was a full by fruitful day. On the About Me I completed my first do while loop, completed if else statements and worked with prompt and alert. I also added some extra features like keeping score of points and inserted a feature that automatically adjusted the number of the console.log var question(number) This could be very useful in pages with lots of sequential statements containing numbers. That way you won't miss number anything.

 I had less time with css and html but experimented with adding a second html page to the project that just contained the js game to separate it from the home page so it doesn't launch right away. The pages were connected with a link. Want to figure out how to add pictures not found on internet so I can load my own pictures.

  In the readings I spent some time with the loops chapter. was excited to learn about && and switch. I think those will be helpful in the future.

   Will finish readings tomorrow morning. thats all for now.
